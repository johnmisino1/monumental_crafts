Many monument dealers today are merely store fronts. 
They only handle the sales of the monument. 
After the sale, the work is performed elsewhere.  
They receive the "finished" product to deliver for you.  

Our monuments are designed by us and are carved and lettered on our premises.  
We do custom designing, cemetery lettering and cleaning and placement of the memorials.  
We also do foundation work where needed.

We are one of a few monument dealers that do our own work such as engraving and design! 
We take great pride in our workmanship. 

Feel free to take a look when you come in! You can see the work being done on your monument...
