<HeadingTitle>Important Information Regarding Our Services
<HeadingStart>Lettering & monument services offered by some funeral homes and cemeteries can cost you more than dealing directly with us.  There are some funeral homes and cemeteries offering you the convenience of purchasing a monument or engraving services through them.  They are relying on you to not seek other sources and use this to their advantage to earn commissions and increase their profits by charging you higher prices.

At Monumental Crafts you buy directly from us-no middleman, no commissions.

We encourage you to not make any quick decisions just based on convenience at a time of bereavement.<HeadingEnd>
